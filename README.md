The repository for the visualization app.

# How to Run
First, open a terminal **in this directory**. Then, enter the following command to install all dependencies:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

Once done, the dataset we used came from the official website, but some columns have been altered to bring a better user experience.
To get this dataset, please use this link: https://we.tl/t-OY6cuGaojk

Once you downloaded the dataset, you move it into the ``dataset``  folder.
Then, it's just a matter of typing:

```python app.py```

in the terminal to start the visualization.

# Where did the code come from?

Most of the code was derived from the course template. A lot of features in there have been reused. Also, the plotly
documentation gave good examples on how to create plots most effectively.
